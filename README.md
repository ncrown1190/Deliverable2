### The COIN FLIP CHALLENGE ###

I am using C# .Net to write this program using if statements, for loop and Random.Next() Method.

## Build Specifications ##
-The user’s name should be stored in a variable so you can reference it later.

-The challenge should only run if the user agrees to it.

  -If the user doesn’t agree, call them a coward and end the program without doing the challenge.
  
-The challenge should have five rounds.

-During each round the program secretly picks a random number: 0 or 1.

-Ask the user for heads or tails. Compare it to the random number.

  -These won’t nicely compare. You will have to come up with how heads and tails relate to 0 and 1.
  
-Each right answer adds one to the total.

First, ask the user, “What is your name?” Store their response in a variable called name. Then ask the user if they want to do the COIN FLIP CHALLENGE. If they type “No”, call them a coward and end the program. If they choose yes, the challenge begins.

The challenge: Create a variable that holds the score. Start it to 0. Create a loop that runs five times. During each loop, get a random number and store that value. That should be a 0 or a 1. Ask the user to enter heads or tails and then store their response. You will then have to compare the random number to the user input. These values will not compare together normally. You will have to get creative to compare them. If the user has successfully guessed the answer, add one to their score and tell the user. Once the loop has finished, the challenge is over. Tell the user their score.
